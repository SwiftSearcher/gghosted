ok i know ghost has about.blank cloaking, but teachers can still see you have a tab open. html files, for some reason, don't show up AT ALL (on GG). just download and open the file. (note: this not any kind of bypass. if ghost is blocked for you, it will still be blocked) lmk if it gets blocked. i am not coding jesus guys litteraly read the html title. if you want to use this just fork and replace url. dont credit me i used a yt iframe tutorial
